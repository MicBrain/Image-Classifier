# Image-Classifier

### What is this project about 

We have a large number of 32x32 images and this project has to find out whether or not each of them contains a cat. In this project, I applied some of the performance optimization techniques to the real-world problem of classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### How does a Computer tell a Cat from a Chair?

   Image classification describes a problem where a computer is given an image and has to tell what it represents (usually from a set of possible categories). Image classification has long been considered a difficult challenge, and a lot of work has been done over the years to improve its accuracy (i.e., what fraction of pictures gets classified correctly).
